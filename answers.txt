Dimension/Fact Design Reasoning:

1. The star schema provides a clear separation between descriptive attributes (dimensions) and measurable events (facts), making it easier to analyze business metrics and perform complex queries. The fact table contains the core business metrics (quantity and total_amount) while the dimension tables provide context and filtering capabilities.

2. The dimension tables are designed to be denormalized, which improves query performance by reducing the number of joins needed. For example, the DIM_PRODUCT table includes both product_name and category, allowing for quick filtering and grouping without additional joins.

3. The DIM_DATE dimension is particularly useful for time-based analysis, enabling easy aggregation by year, month, quarter, or day. The inclusion of flags like is_weekend and is_holiday allows for special time period analysis.

4. The fact table (FACT_ORDERS) serves as the central point for all order-related metrics, with foreign keys to all dimension tables. This design allows for comprehensive analysis of orders across different dimensions (customer, product, time) while maintaining data integrity through referential constraints.



Handling Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD):

1. Type 1 SCD (Overwrite): The current implementation uses Type 1 SCD for most attributes, where changes simply overwrite the existing values. This is evident in the DIM_CUSTOMER and DIM_PRODUCT tables, which have updated_at timestamps but don't maintain historical values.

2. Type 2 SCD (Historical Tracking): To implement Type 2 SCD, we would need to:
a: Add effective_date and end_date columns to track when each version was valid
b: Add a version number or surrogate key to distinguish between different versions
c: Create a new record when an attribute changes instead of updating the existing one
d: Update the end_date of the previous version when a new version is created

3. Type 3 SCD (Limited History): For attributes where we need to track both current and previous values, we could add columns like previous_value and previous_value_date.

4. Hybrid Approach: We could implement different SCD types for different attributes based on business requirements. For example:
a: Use Type 1 for attributes that don't need historical tracking (e.g., customer_name)
b: Use Type 2 for attributes that need full historical tracking (e.g., customer_region)
c: Use Type 3 for attributes where we only need to know the previous value (e.g., product_price)
